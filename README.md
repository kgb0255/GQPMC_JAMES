GQP Mock Challenge James

Completed in April 9th 2020.

DESI survey stands for Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey which will observe tens of millions of galaxies
for cosmological studies.

Before the survey gets commissioned, we generate noiseless spectra and forward model them to DESI spectra. We test our inference
methods here to check if inferred cosmological parameters are close to the truths and if the inference are done efficiently. Here, I perform the mock challenge of Galaxy/Quasar Physics Group written by Dr. Changhoon Hahn (http://changhoonhahn.github.io/),
to improve/supplement the inference methods.
