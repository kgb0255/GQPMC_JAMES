GQP Mock Challenge James

DESI survey stands for Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey which will observe tens of millions of galaxies
for cosmological studies. Here, I perform the mock challenge of Galaxy/Quasar Physics Group by Dr. Changhoon Hahn,
to improve/supplement the inference methods.

Before the survey begins, we generate noiseless spectra and forward model them to DESI spectra. We test our inference
methods here to check if inferred cosmological parameters are close to the truths and if the inference are done efficiently.
